Given a service running on a set of servers, each with an initial % success factor
- Design a load balancer to distribute load between servers
- Design the same load balancer for the case when the success factor can change dynamically over a period of time.

You have to write the code for both the parts and make a functional demo. The demo can have any interface (CLI/webapp).
